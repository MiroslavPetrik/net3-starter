# Since the ".env" file is gitignored, you can use the ".env.example" file to
# build a new ".env" file when you clone the repo. Keep this file up-to-date
# when you add new variables to `.env`.

# This file will be committed to version control, so make sure not to have any
# secrets in it. If you are cloning this repo, create a copy of this file named
# ".env" and populate it with your secrets.

# When adding additional environment variables, the schema in "/src/env.mjs"
# should be updated accordingly.

# Get DSN with the command `npm run db:dsn`:
# EDGEDB_DSN="edgedb://username:password@localhost:port/edgedb"

# Note: when developing locally you will need to set tls security to insecure,
# because the development server uses self-signed certificates which will cause api calls with the fetch api to fail.
